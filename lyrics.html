        <pre>
    Fly me to the moon
    Let me play among the stars
    Let me see what spring is like
    On a-Jupiter and Mars
    In other words, hold my hand
    In other words, baby, kiss me

    Fill my heart with song
    And let me sing forevermore
    You are all I long for
    All I worship and adore
    In other words, please be true
    In other words, I love you

    Fill my heart with song
    Let me sing for ever more
    You are all I long for
    All I worship and adore
    In other words, please be true
    In other words, in other words
    I love you
        </pre>
